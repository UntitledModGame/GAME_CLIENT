# Lessons learned from UMG:


## Business/Product lessons:
- Put the customer first
- Capitalize on strengths
- Themeing is a neccessity
- Don't waste time on irrellevant shit
- Iterate faster; try many smaller products instead of 1 big one
- Game FEEL is very important
- We need to take advantage of analytics EARLIER.


## Technical lessons:
- YAGNI, KISS
- It doesn't need to be "big brained" and "elegant". Embrace grug dev.
- Depth is bad. Prefer shallow structure
- Abstraction has a complexity cost
- Hard constraints are not bad. Pick the right ones, and commit to them EARLY.


# OBJECTIVE:
Try get a working demo out as *fast* as possible.   
Doesn't matter about anything else.
