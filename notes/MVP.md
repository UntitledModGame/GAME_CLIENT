# MVP:

Playable sandbox game.
The absolute bare-neccessary features that we need:


MAKER-CLIENT:
- Mods can be uploaded
- Gamemodes can be uploaded
- Players can search for mods to add (JUST STATIC-DATA SEARCH!!!)

LAUNCH-CLIENT:
- Gamemodes can be chosen from
- You can create / join servers
- (^^^ MAKE SURE ITS SUPER SIMPLE. Younguns dont use serverlists these days)

GAME-CLIENT:
- You can play/host a game.
- Grid-system
- Usable/holdable items
- Multiplayer syncing
- (^^^ thats honestly it.. we dont need anything fancy)

LESS LINES OF CODE IS BETTER. Remember tinygrad.
Embrace YAGNI. Add it later after you have secured VC.


For maker-client mod-search, dont do a stupid cloud-based search.
Just keep it really fucking simple.  
Have a static-list of all mods, and update them manually;
(push and deploy at end of day or somethn?)
