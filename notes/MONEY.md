# Money / Monetization:


Free to play.


Players can buy skins / cosmetics / in-game purchases.
-> Modders / Makers should be able to monetize however they want too
^^^ do some more thinking about this!


Revenue share:
30% goes to UMG company
35% goes to Makers pool
35% goes to Modders pool

Makers earn money from the Maker's pool based on how popular their gamemodes are.
Modders earn money from the Modders's pool based on how frequently their extensions are used.

This is nice since it doesn't discourage Makers from using Modder's tools.
