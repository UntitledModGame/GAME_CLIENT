# TODO:


PLAN: Make a *huge* plan of stuff.
- What can we reuse from umg?
- Should we have base-mods, like umg?
- What needs to be implemented first?

Make a step-by-step list of things that need to be tackled.


- STEP-1: Get launcher working. (We need to run the code to test it)

- STEP-2: Get client/server booting working

- STEP-3: Get (simple) modloading working


# ANYTHING BELOW THIS POINT = DONE.
