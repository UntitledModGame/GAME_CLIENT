# Maker Client
(See `VISION.md` if you dont understand this)



## DONT UNDERESTIMATE!!
IMO, the Maker-Client could be THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO GET RIGHT.
This is mainly because it hasn't been done elsewhere, so we cant copy anyone.

If it's done well though, it would be SO INCREDIBLY GOOD.



## Key features:
- Provide starter-templates
- See what mods are loaded easily
- Search entities / prefabs, EG. Maker searches "gun"; chooses to use it
- Search mods to add
- Manage uploading / downloading of stuff
- Manage metadata

## NON features:
What does the Maker-Client NOT do?  
- Provide tools for placing/editing objects in the world 
    (^^^^ would require complex dual-handling of resources)
- 



## Templates:
To get players started, starting-templates should exist.  
(Modders can create/upload their own custom templates)

--------------
CTM: Complete the monument
Tycoon: Make as much money as possible!
Roles: Players get/choose roles, EG. a city sim. Mayor, Police, Farmers, etc.
Deathmatch: free-for-all, fight to the death, respawn quickly
Survival: PvE, Try to survive for a certain amount of time (like COD zombies?)
Sandbox: (Starts with nothing)


^^^^ things to consider:
- We probably want `.team` to be a component defined in core
- For Tycoon / Role games, we probably want a currency mod / currency system...? Defined in core...?
