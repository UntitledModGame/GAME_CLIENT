# VISION:

Here entails my vision for the new umg platform:



2 "types" of creators:
"Modders" and "Makers"


## Modders:
- Create objects / entityTypes in lua
- Bundle modpacks together with scripts
- (ADVANCED) Create systems
- (ADVANCED) Create tools


## Makers:
Creates games and gamemodes.
Uses level-editors, and generally doesn't write much code.

Makers can deploy their game with a click of the button.



-----------


The idea is that Modders will create stuff that Makers can use.  

To help with this, there should be an auxiliary program (Maker Client)
that runs alongside the game-client.
The Maker-Client should provide a tonne of features that aids in development

For example, a Maker should just be able to search: "gun", 
and a bunch of "gun" objects should show up in the search. Makers can just click the gun,
and use it in their game super easily.
Same with mobs,  
same with spawners, etc etc.  Any kind of thing.

UX IS PARAMOUNT.



## MONETIZATION:

- Players buy skins / cosmetics
- Players buy in-game
